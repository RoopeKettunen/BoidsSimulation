Progress Report #1:
week 7 (20.2 - 26.2):
- Created initial class structure and basic dependencies
- Finished Vector2 file based on initial plan, and completed a few simple methods in other classes
week 8 (27.2 - 5.3)
- Created basic GUI frame and sliders, and began experimenting with drawing Boids
General Info:
- I have spent about 5 hours total during this two-week period, and I perhaps could have spent a little more
- The workload will likely increase when implementing more complex functions of the project
- I am on schedule based on the initial plan
- I hope to at least get the GUI redering/animations working within the next two weeks if not more
- The vector class still needs to be tested, but everything else thus far functions

Progress Report #2:
week 9 (6.3 - 12.3)
- Tested the vector class and fixed minor bugs
- Created a basic animation clock that moves the now correctly drawn boids around
week 10 (13.3 - 19.3)
- Implemented basic slider functionality
- Made it so that each boid has an initial facing
- Adjusted for edge cases so that each boid, when bumping into an edge will teleport to the other side of screen
- Could not manage to fix the shaking of two side boxes
- Created Orient method, though it is still under progress
- Still need to fix the GUI that has rendering, GridPane shaking, and edge teleporting problems
General Info
- The orient method visually works, but unit tests still need to be written and run
- Trying to get the physics of the Boids to work was quite a problem, and could still use some fine-tuning
- The workload was about 8 hours and was to be expected and I got a lot done last minute
- I am ever so slightly ahead, but with the GUI to fix and a few likely bugs, I'll say I'm on track

Progress Report #3:
Week 11 (20.3 - 26.3)
- Fixed GUI shaking and edge teleporting'
Week 12 (27.3 - 2.4)
- Completely debugged the orient method that turned out to not be working properly
- aslo fixed how the weights can now actually affect boid behavior properly
- Attempted to create unit tests but could not get import/sbt to work
- have not worked enough at all, maybe like 5 hours
- still pretty much on time as long as I can pick up the pace in the last two weeks
- still need to remember to write the final report as well

Progress Report #4:
Week 13 (3.4 - 9.4)
- Got the scalatest import to work
- File reader that now initializes the number of boids along with the initial weights for the three rules
- Unit tested a two Boid simulation and got tests to pass
- Discovered and corrected bugs such as distance of Boids not being accounted for in separation
- Also fixed position and velocity updating order (more detailed description in commits)
- Commented code (rudimentally) and created a toggle button and slider to adjust viewRadius of each boid
Week 14 (10.4 - 16.4)
- Added Obstacle functionality to GUI, Simulation, and DataReader
- Added additional error catching with text file reading
- Fixed the Alignment calculations in the Boid class
Week 15 (17.4 - 19.4)
- Adjusted edge teleporting and boid edge vision to create proper edge wrapping
- created fps counter in console
- Added boid number adjustment buttons and a boid number slider
- Added pause/resume button
- Added obstacle adding functionality with mouse clicks, and an obstacle clearing button that removes all of the obstacles
- Reformatted edge wrapping check in the orient method of the Boid class to slightly improve performance
- Also added speed adjustment

Interim Report Instructions:
1-3 lines description of what classes have been added or updated and what functionality have been implemented in them (even if they were not ready yet).

What methods / functionality have been tested so far in classes so that they work properly?

What possibly difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?

What has been the workload used during this time with some 5 hours accuracy?

Whether you are ahead or lagging behind what you presented in the project plan (roughly at this phase).
